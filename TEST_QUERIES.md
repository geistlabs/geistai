## üéØ Edge Cases to Test

### Complex Multi-Step Query
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/stream \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Compare the weather in Paris, London, and New York"}]}'
```

### Ambiguous Query (Tests Routing)
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/stream \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Tell me about the latest in Paris"}]}'
```

### Long Context
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/stream \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is the weather in Paris? Also, can you explain what causes weather patterns? And then tell me a joke about the weather?"}]}'
```

## üìä What to Look For

### Router Logs (Terminal 2)
```
üéØ Query routed to: qwen_tools     # Tool-calling query
üéØ Query routed to: gpt_oss        # Creative/simple query
üéØ Query routed to: qwen_direct    # Complex but no tools
```

### GPU Logs (Terminal 1)
```
üìç Request to Qwen (port 8080)
üìç Request to GPT-OSS (port 8082)
```

### Response Quality
- **Speed**: Tool queries ~10-20s, simple queries ~2-5s
- **Content**: Check for Harmony markers (`<|channel|>`, `We need to check...`)
- **Sources**: Tool queries should include source URLs
- **Accuracy**: Responses should match the query intent

---

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Harmony Format Artifacts** (Minor):
   - GPT-OSS may include meta-commentary like "We need to check..."
   - Responses may have `<|channel|>analysis` markers
   - Post-processing attempts to clean these up

2. **Tool Result Size**:
   - Findings truncated to 200 chars per source (max 3 sources)
   - This is intentional for speed

3. **First Query Slow**:
   - First inference request may be slower (model warmup)
   - Subsequent queries should be faster
