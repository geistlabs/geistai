# Tool Calling Problem - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**System**: GeistAI MVP
**Severity**: Critical ‚Äî Blocking 30% of user queries

---

## Problem Statement

**GPT-OSS 20B is fundamentally broken for tool-calling queries in our system.**

Tool-calling queries (weather, news, current information) result in:

- **60+ second timeouts** with zero response to users
- **Infinite tool-calling loops** (6‚Äì10 iterations before giving up)
- **No user-facing content generated** (`saw_content=False` in every iteration)
- **100% failure rate** for queries requiring tools

---

## Empirical Evidence

**Example Query**: "What's the weather in Paris, France?"

**Expected Behavior**:

```
User query ‚Üí brave_web_search ‚Üí fetch ‚Üí Generate response
Total time: 8‚Äì15 seconds
Output: "The weather in Paris is 18¬∞C with partly cloudy skies..."
```

**Actual Behavior**:

```
Timeline:
  0s:  Query received by router
  3s:  Orchestrator calls current_info_agent
  5s:  Agent calls brave_web_search (iteration 1)
  8s:  Agent calls fetch (iteration 1)
  10s: finish_reason=tool_calls, saw_content=False

  12s: Agent continues (iteration 2)
  15s: Agent calls brave_web_search again
  18s: Agent calls fetch again
  20s: finish_reason=tool_calls, saw_content=False

  ... repeats ...

  45s: Forcing final response (tools removed)
  48s: finish_reason=tool_calls (still calling tools)

  60s: Test timeout

  Content received: 0 chunks, 0 characters
  User sees: Nothing (blank screen or timeout error)
```

### Router Logs Evidence

```
üîÑ Tool calling loop iteration 6/10 for agent: current_info_agent
üõë Forcing final response after 5 tool calls
üèÅ finish_reason=tool_calls, saw_content=False
üîÑ Tool calling loop iteration 7/10
...
```

Even after removing all tools and injecting "DO NOT call more tools" messages, the model keeps producing tool calls and never user-facing content.

---

## Current Implementation

### Tool Calling Logic

**File: `backend/router/gpt_service.py` (lines 484-533)**

Our tool calling loop implementation:

```python
# Main tool calling loop
tool_call_count = 0
MAX_TOOL_CALLS = 10
FORCE_RESPONSE_AFTER = 2  # Force answer after 2 tool iterations

while tool_call_count < MAX_TOOL_CALLS:
    print(f"üîÑ Tool calling loop iteration {tool_call_count + 1}/{MAX_TOOL_CALLS}")

    # FORCE RESPONSE MODE: After N tool calls, force the LLM to answer
    force_response = tool_call_count >= FORCE_RESPONSE_AFTER
    if force_response:
        print(f"üõë Forcing final response after {tool_call_count} tool calls")

        # Inject system message
        conversation.append({
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You have finished executing tools. "
                "You MUST now provide your final answer to the user based on the tool results above. "
                "DO NOT call any more tools. DO NOT say you need more information. "
                "Generate your complete response NOW using only the information you already have."
            )
        })

        # Remove tools to prevent hallucinated calls
        original_tool_registry = self._tool_registry
        self._tool_registry = {}  # No tools available

    # Send request to LLM
    async for content_chunk, status in process_llm_response_with_tools(...):
        if content_chunk:
            yield content_chunk  # Stream to user

        if status == "stop":
            return  # Normal completion
        elif status == "continue":
            tool_call_count += 1
            break  # Continue loop for next iteration
```

**What Happens with GPT-OSS 20B**:

1. Iteration 1: Calls brave_web_search, fetch ‚Üí `finish_reason=tool_calls`, `saw_content=False`
2. Iteration 2: Calls brave_web_search, fetch again ‚Üí `finish_reason=tool_calls`, `saw_content=False`
3. Iteration 3: Force response mode triggers, tools removed
4. Iteration 3+: **STILL returns `tool_calls`** even with no tools available
5. Eventually hits MAX_TOOL_CALLS and times out

---

### Agent Prompt Instructions

**File: `backend/router/agent_tool.py` (lines 249-280)**

The `current_info_agent` system prompt (used for weather/news queries):

```python
def create_current_info_agent(config) -> AgentTool:
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    return AgentTool(
        name="current_info_agent",
        description="Use this tool to get up-to-date information from the web.",
        system_prompt=(
            f"You are a current information specialist (today: {current_date}).\n\n"

            "TOOL USAGE WORKFLOW:\n"
            "1. If user provides a URL: call fetch(url) once, extract facts, then ANSWER immediately.\n"
            "2. If no URL: call brave_web_search(query) once, review results, call fetch on 1-2 best URLs, then ANSWER immediately.\n"
            "3. CRITICAL: Once you have fetched content, you MUST generate your final answer. DO NOT call more tools.\n"
            "4. If fetch fails: try one different URL, then answer with what you have.\n\n"

            "IMPORTANT: After calling fetch and getting results, the NEXT message you generate MUST be your final answer to the user. Do not call tools again.\n\n"

            "OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
            "- Provide 1-3 concise sentences with key facts (include units like ¬∞C, timestamps if available).\n"
            "- End with sources in this exact format:\n"
            "  Sources:\n"
            "  [1] <site name> ‚Äî <url>\n"
            "  [2] <site name> ‚Äî <url>\n\n"

            "RULES:\n"
            "- Never tell user to visit a website or return only links\n"
            "- Never use result_filters\n"
            "- Disambiguate locations (e.g., 'Paris France' not just 'Paris')\n"
            "- Prefer recent/fresh content when available\n"
        ),
        available_tools=["brave_web_search", "brave_summarizer", "fetch"],
        reasoning_effort="low"
    )
```

**What the Prompt Says**:

- ‚úÖ "call brave_web_search **once**"
- ‚úÖ "call fetch on 1-2 best URLs, then **ANSWER immediately**"
- ‚úÖ "**CRITICAL**: Once you have fetched content, you MUST generate your final answer. **DO NOT call more tools**"
- ‚úÖ "**IMPORTANT**: The NEXT message you generate MUST be your final answer"

**What GPT-OSS 20B Actually Does**:

- ‚ùå Calls brave_web_search (iteration 1) ‚úì
- ‚ùå Calls fetch (iteration 1) ‚úì
- ‚ùå **Then calls brave_web_search AGAIN** (iteration 2) ‚úó
- ‚ùå **Then calls fetch AGAIN** (iteration 2) ‚úó
- ‚ùå Repeats 6-10 times
- ‚ùå **Never generates final answer**

**Conclusion**: The model **completely ignores** the prompt instructions.

### Tool Execution (Works Correctly)

**File: `backend/router/simple_mcp_client.py`**

Tools execute successfully and return valid data:

```python
# Example: brave_web_search for "weather in Paris"
{
  "content": '{"url":"https://www.bbc.com/weather/2988507","title":"Paris - BBC Weather","description":"Partly cloudy and light winds"}...',
  "status": "success"
}

# Example: fetch returns full weather page
{
  "content": "Paris, France\n\nAs of 5:04 pm CEST\n\n66¬∞Sunny\nDay 66¬∞ ‚Ä¢ Night 50¬∞...",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**Tools provide all necessary data**:

- Temperature: ‚úÖ 66¬∞F / 18¬∞C
- Conditions: ‚úÖ Sunny
- Location: ‚úÖ Paris, France
- Timestamp: ‚úÖ 5:04 pm CEST

**Agent has everything needed to answer** - but never does.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing User-Facing Content

**Observation:** `saw_content=False` in 100% of tool-calling iterations.
**Hypothesis:** The model uses the _Harmony reasoning format_ incorrectly. It generates text only in `reasoning_content` (internal thoughts) and leaves `content` empty.
**Evidence:** Simple (non-tool) queries work correctly ‚Üí issue isolated to tool-calling context.
**Verification Plan:** Capture raw JSON deltas from inference server to confirm whether only `reasoning_content` is populated.

### 2. Infinite Tool-Calling Loops

**Observation:** The model continues calling tools indefinitely, ignoring "stop" instructions.
**Hypothesis:** GPT‚ÄëOSS 20B was fine-tuned to always rely on tools and lacks instruction-following alignment.
**Evidence:** Continues tool calls even when tools are removed from request.

### 3. Hallucinated Tool Calls

**Observation:** The model requests tools even after all were removed from the registry.
**Conclusion:** Model behavior is pattern-driven rather than conditioned on actual tool availability.

## Impact Assessment

| Type of Query         | Result         | Status        |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Weather, news, search | Timeout (60 s) | ‚ùå Broken     |
| Creative writing      | Works (2‚Äì5 s)  | ‚úÖ            |
| Simple Q&A            | Works (5‚Äì10 s) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable |

Roughly **30% of total user queries** fail, blocking the MVP launch.

---

## Confirmed Non-Issues

- MCP tools (`brave_web_search`, `fetch`) execute successfully.
- Networking and Docker services function correctly.
- Prompt engineering and context size changes do **not** fix the issue.
