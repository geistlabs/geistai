# ‚úÖ Option A: Increased Findings Context

## üéØ **What We Changed**

### File: `backend/router/gpt_service.py`

**Function**: `_extract_tool_findings()` (lines 424-459)

### Changes Made:

1. **Increased truncation limit**: `200 chars ‚Üí 1000 chars`

   ```python
   # Before
   if len(content) > 200:
       content = content[:200] + "..."

   # After
   if len(content) > 1000:
       content = content[:1000] + "..."
   ```

2. **Increased max findings**: `3 findings ‚Üí 5 findings`

   ```python
   # Before
   return "\n".join(findings[:3])

   # After
   return "\n\n---\n\n".join(findings[:5])
   ```

3. **Better separator**: Added `---` between findings for clarity

---

## üìä **Expected Impact**

### Before:

- Findings truncated to 200 chars per result
- Only 3 results max
- **Total context**: ~600 characters
- **Result**: Llama says "I can't access the links"

### After:

- Findings truncated to 1000 chars per result
- Up to 5 results
- **Total context**: ~5000 characters
- **Expected**: Llama should have enough context to provide better answers

---

## üß™ **How to Test**

1. **Ask a weather question**:

   ```
   "What's the weather like in Tokyo?"
   ```

2. **Check the logs**:

   ```bash
   docker logs backend-router-local-1 --tail 50
   ```

3. **Look for**:

   ```
   üìù Calling answer_mode with Llama (faster) - findings (XXXX chars)
   ```

   - Should now show ~1000-5000 chars instead of ~200

4. **Check answer quality**:
   - Should mention actual weather data (temperature, conditions, etc.)
   - Should NOT say "I can't access the links"

---

## ‚ö° **Performance Trade-off**

### Speed Impact:

- **More context** = more tokens for Llama to process
- **Estimated slowdown**: +2-3 seconds
- **Old**: ~21 seconds total
- **New**: ~23-24 seconds total (still under 25s target)

### Quality Improvement:

- **5x more context** (200 ‚Üí 1000 chars)
- **Better answers** with actual data instead of guesses
- **Fewer "I can't access" responses**

---

## üö® **Known Limitations**

This fix **does NOT solve**:

1. **No actual page fetching**: Still using search result snippets only

   - To fix: Need to enable 2nd tool call for `fetch()`

2. **Slow first response**: Still takes ~18 seconds for first token

   - To fix: Need to optimize Qwen inference speed

3. **No caching**: Same weather query re-fetches every time
   - To fix: Add Redis/memory caching layer

---

## üìù **Next Steps If This Doesn't Work**

### If answer quality is still poor:

**Option B**: Allow 2 tool calls (search + fetch)

```python
# In gpt_service.py
FORCE_RESPONSE_AFTER = 2  # Instead of 1
```

### If it's too slow:

**Focus on speed optimization**:

1. Profile Qwen inference (why 18s for first token?)
2. Check GPU utilization
3. Optimize thread count
4. Consider smaller model for tool calls

---

## ‚úÖ **Status**

- [x] Code updated
- [x] Router restarted
- [ ] Tested with weather query
- [ ] Verified improved answer quality
- [ ] Checked performance impact

## üöÄ **Ready to Test!**

Try asking: **"What's the weather like in Tokyo?"**

Watch your frontend console and check if:

1. Response is better quality ‚úÖ
2. Response time is acceptable (~23-24s) ‚úÖ
3. No "I can't access" errors ‚úÖ

Let me know what you see! üéØ
