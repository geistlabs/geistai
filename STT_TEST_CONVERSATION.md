# 🎤 Speech-to-Text Testing Conversation

## 🚀 Quick Setup

1. Make sure your backend is running: `cd backend && ./start-local-dev.sh`
2. Make sure your frontend is running: `cd frontend && npx expo start`
3. Open the app on your device/simulator
4. Navigate to the chat screen
5. Look for the microphone button (🎤) in the input area

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Basic Functionality**

**Goal**: Verify the STT feature works end-to-end

**What to say**: "Hello, this is a test of the speech to text feature"

**Expected result**:

- ✅ Microphone button should respond when pressed
- ✅ Recording should start (visual feedback)
- ✅ After speaking, text should appear in the chat input
- ✅ You should be able to send the transcribed message

---

### **Test 2: Short Phrases**

**Goal**: Test quick, simple commands

**Test phrases**:

1. "What's the weather like?"
2. "Tell me a joke"
3. "Help me with coding"
4. "Explain quantum computing"

**Expected result**:

- ✅ All phrases should be accurately transcribed
- ✅ Transcription should be fast (< 3 seconds)
- ✅ No garbled or missing text

---

### **Test 3: Longer, Complex Sentences**

**Goal**: Test accuracy with longer content

**What to say**: "I would like you to help me understand how machine learning algorithms work, specifically focusing on neural networks and their applications in natural language processing"

**Expected result**:

- ✅ Should handle longer sentences well
- ✅ Technical terms should be transcribed accurately
- ✅ Punctuation and context should be preserved

---

### **Test 4: Numbers and Special Characters**

**Goal**: Test transcription of numbers and technical content

**What to say**: "The meeting is scheduled for March 15th at 3:30 PM. The project budget is $50,000 and we need to deliver by Q2 2024"

**Expected result**:

- ✅ Numbers should be transcribed correctly
- ✅ Dates and times should be accurate
- ✅ Currency and technical terms should work

---

### **Test 5: Background Noise Handling**

**Goal**: Test robustness in different environments

**Test setup**:

- Try recording in a quiet room first
- Then try with some background noise (TV, music, etc.)

**What to say**: "Testing speech recognition with background noise"

**Expected result**:

- ✅ Should still work reasonably well with moderate noise
- ✅ May have some accuracy reduction but should be functional

---

### **Test 6: Multiple Languages (if applicable)**

**Goal**: Test language detection

**Test phrases**:

1. "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" (Spanish)
2. "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?" (French)
3. "Hello, how are you?" (English)

**Expected result**:

- ✅ Should auto-detect language correctly
- ✅ Non-English should be transcribed accurately
- ✅ Language switching should work seamlessly

---

### **Test 7: Edge Cases**

**Goal**: Test system limits and error handling

**Test scenarios**:

1. **Very short recording**: Just say "Hi"
2. **Very long recording**: Speak for 30+ seconds
3. **Silence**: Record with no speech
4. **Interruption**: Start recording, then stop immediately

**Expected results**:

- ✅ Short recordings should work (minimum 1 second)
- ✅ Long recordings should be handled gracefully
- ✅ Silent recordings should give appropriate feedback
- ✅ Interrupted recordings should not crash the app

---

### **Test 8: UI/UX Flow**

**Goal**: Test the complete user experience

**Steps to test**:

1. Tap microphone button
2. Speak clearly
3. Wait for transcription
4. Review the transcribed text
5. Edit if needed
6. Send the message
7. Verify the message appears in chat

**Expected result**:

- ✅ Smooth, intuitive flow
- ✅ Clear visual feedback during recording
- ✅ Easy to edit transcribed text
- ✅ Seamless integration with chat

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue**: "Failed to start recording"

**Solutions**:

- Check microphone permissions in your device settings
- Make sure the app has audio recording permissions
- Try restarting the app

### **Issue**: "STT request failed: 404"

**Solutions**:

- Verify backend is running on port 8000
- Check that the STT service is properly configured
- Look at backend logs for errors

### **Issue**: Poor transcription accuracy

**Solutions**:

- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Reduce background noise
- Try shorter phrases
- Check microphone quality

### **Issue**: No audio format supported

**Solutions**:

- Verify expo-audio is properly configured for WAV output
- Check that the backend expects WAV format
- Look for format mismatch errors in logs

## 📊 Success Criteria

**✅ Test Passed If**:

- [ ] All test scenarios complete without crashes
- [ ] Transcription accuracy is >80% for clear speech
- [ ] Response time is <5 seconds for typical phrases
- [ ] UI provides clear feedback during recording
- [ ] Integration with chat works seamlessly
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully

**❌ Test Failed If**:

- [ ] App crashes during recording
- [ ] Transcription never appears
- [ ] Severe accuracy issues (>50% errors)
- [ ] Very slow response times (>10 seconds)
- [ ] UI becomes unresponsive
- [ ] Integration breaks the chat flow

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass**: The STT feature is ready for production use
2. **If some tests fail**: Note which scenarios failed and we can debug them
3. **Performance issues**: We can optimize the Whisper model or recording settings
4. **Accuracy issues**: We can fine-tune the audio recording parameters

**Happy Testing! 🎤✨**

_Remember: The first few tests might be slower as the Whisper model loads. Subsequent tests should be faster._
