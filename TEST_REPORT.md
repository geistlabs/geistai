## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Observations

### Issue 1: Tool-Calling Queries Are Slow

**Impact:** Weather queries take 36-69s (target was 10-15s)

**Analysis:**

- Tool execution: ~3-5s (acceptable)
- Answer generation: ~30-40s (too slow)
- Total: ~40-70s (2-4x slower than target)

**Likely Causes:**

1. Answer mode using 512 max_tokens (too high)
2. Temperature 0.2 (too low, slower sampling)
3. Large context from tool results

**Potential Fixes:**

- Reduce max_tokens to 256 in `answer_mode.py`
- Increase temperature to 0.7
- Truncate tool results more aggressively

### Issue 2: Code Queries Are Very Slow

**Impact:** Code implementation takes 140s (acceptable for detailed responses)

**Analysis:**

- This is expected for complex code generation
- Includes detailed explanations and examples
- Quality is excellent, so trade-off may be acceptable

**Not a critical issue** - users expect detailed code to take longer

### Issue 3: GPT-OSS Shows Harmony Format Markers

**Impact:** Creative responses include `<|channel|>analysis` markers

**Analysis:**

- This is the Harmony format's internal reasoning
- Should be filtered out before showing to user
- Doesn't affect functionality, just presentation

**Fix:** Add Harmony format parser to strip markers in post-processing

## üöÄ Recommendations

### Priority 1: Optimize Answer Generation (High Impact)

**Goal:** Reduce tool-calling query time from 47s to 15s

**Actions:**

1. Modify `answer_mode.py`:
   ```python
   "max_tokens": 256  # from 512
   "temperature": 0.7  # from 0.2
   ```
2. Truncate tool findings to 300 chars max
3. Re-test weather query to measure improvement

**Expected Impact:** 50-70% reduction in answer time

### Priority 2: Filter Harmony Format Markers (Low Impact)

**Goal:** Clean up GPT-OSS responses for user presentation

**Actions:**

1. Add post-processing to strip `<|channel|>`, `<|message|>`, `<|end|>` markers
2. Extract only the `final` channel content
3. Test with creative queries

**Expected Impact:** Better UX, cleaner responses

### Priority 3: Monitor Long-Running Code Queries (Low Priority)

**Goal:** Ensure code generation doesn't time out

**Actions:**

1. Monitor code queries in production
2. Consider adding progress indicators for long queries
3. Set reasonable max_tokens limits

**Expected Impact:** Better user experience for code queries

>
> ```python
> def binary_search(arr, target):
>     left = 0
>     right = len(arr) - 1
>
>     while left <= right:
>         mid = (left + right) // 2
>
>         if arr[mid] == target:
>             return mid  # Target found
>         elif arr[mid] < target:
>             left = mid + 1
>         else:
>             right = mid - 1
>
>     return -1  # Target not found
